Problem: Creating multilingual content can be a barrier for some editors.
Solution: Develop a translation tool to support multilingual content creation. This tool would allow editors from different language backgrounds to collaborate more easily.

So in this the output will be of two columns.
The left column shows a search bar and an scrape button.
In the search bar we give input of keywords or the wikipedia urls to get the context of the wikipedia page.
The right column shows about the translations.
We can choose the language (here there only 3 languages), and we can translate them into the particular language.

For executing this code we use Flask.
We need to install the required python libraries.
The command goes : "pip install flask beautifulsoup4 requests" (We are using VS Code).
To run the code we run the command: "flask run".
This code runs the code app.py.
